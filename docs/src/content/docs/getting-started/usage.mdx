The [Application](/docs/components/application) component will create your PixiJS app and canvas for you.

All Svelte Pixi components should be children of `Application`.

```svelte example csr noApp
<script>
  import { Application, Text } from 'svelte-pixi'
</script>

<Application width={400} height={400}>
  <Text
    text="Hello World"
    anchor={0.5}
    x={200}
    y={200}
    style={{
      fill: 'white',
    }}
  />
</Application>
```

## Sprites

Sprite components take a `texture`, so we'll use `PIXI.Texture.from` to load one from a URL.

PixiJS will load the texture in the background and show it when it's ready - similar to how an `img` tag works.

```svelte example csr noApp
<script>
  import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js'
  import { Application, Sprite } from 'svelte-pixi'
</script>

<Application width={400} height={400}>
  <Sprite
    texture={PIXI.Texture.from('/assets/food/lemonpie.png')}
    anchor={0.5}
    x={200}
    y={200}
    scale={2}
  />
</Application>
```

## Loaders

If you have a bunch of images or other resources, you may wish to show a loading screen until all images have finished loading (rather than have them pop in one after another).

_Note: You may want to enable network throttling in your browser dev tools to actually see the loading screen - these are small images!_

```svelte example csr noApp
<script>
  import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js'
  import { Application, Text, Sprite, AssetsLoader } from 'svelte-pixi'

  let images = [
    '/assets/food/lemonpie.png',
    '/assets/food/strawberrycake.png',
    '/assets/food/cheesecake.png',
  ]
</script>

<Application width={400} height={400}>
  <AssetsLoader assets={images}>
    <slot slot="loading">
      <Text
        text="Loading..."
        anchor={0.5}
        x={200}
        y={200}
        style={{
          fill: 'white',
        }}
      />
    </slot>

    {#each images as image, i}
      <Sprite
        texture={PIXI.Texture.from(image)}
        anchor={0.5}
        x={150 + i * 50}
        y={200}
        scale={2}
      />
    {/each}
  </AssetsLoader>
</Application>
```

You can have multiple AssetsLoader components as well, which could be useful if you wanted to render a fallbacks at a component-level instead.

## Ticker

A [Ticker](/docs/components/ticker) runs an update loop for the application. The `Application` component will create one automatically, which means child components can hook into the loop with `onTick`.

```svelte example csr
<script>
  import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js'
  import { Sprite, onTick } from 'svelte-pixi'

  let x = 200
  let y = 200

  let count = 0
  onTick((delta) => {
    count += delta * 0.05
    x = 200 + Math.cos(count) * 50
    y = 200 + Math.sin(count) * 50
  })
</script>

<Sprite
  texture={PIXI.Texture.from('/assets/food/lemonpie.png')}
  anchor={0.5}
  {x}
  {y}
  scale={2}
/>
```

## Accessing PixiJS Instances

Most Svelte Pixi components have an `instance` prop that contains the underlying PixiJS instance. It is like the `this` prop for HTML elements, so you can bind to it if you need to access it.

```svelte example csr
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte'
  import { Text } from 'svelte-pixi'

  let text

  onMount(() => {
    text.style.fill = 'yellow'
  })
</script>

<Text bind:instance={text} text="Hello World" anchor={0.5} x={200} y={200} />
```

## Using a Custom Instance

The `instance` prop also lets you pass down a custom PixiJS class that you've instantiated yourself. This is particularly useful if you have a custom class (whether that be your own or from a third-party library).

```svelte example csr
<script>
  import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js'
  import { Text } from 'svelte-pixi'

  class YellowText extends PIXI.Text {
    constructor(text, style) {
      super(text, style)
      this.style.fill = 'yellow'
    }
  }

  let text = new YellowText()
</script>

<Text instance={text} text="Hello World" anchor={0.5} x={200} y={200} />
```
